**QSample Client** serves as the presentation layer for QSample. This repository is designed to function as a submodule within the **[QSample Server](https://github.com/proteomicsunitcrg/qsample-server)** repository. Therefore, it does not require standalone installation. Simply follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/proteomicsunitcrg/qsample-server/wiki/Point-5:-Server-and-Database-installation#pull-build-start-qsample-server-and-database) to set up the QSample Server and its associated components.
